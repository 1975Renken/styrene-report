## Executive Summary
Our analysis demonstrates that the base styrene manufacturing process generates $11.8 million in annual profit, with potential optimizations increasing this to $18.8 million annually. Key improvements focus on reducing process water usage and implementing a refrigeration cycle for ethylbenzene recycling, while maintaining environmental compliance, process safety, and product quality standards.

## Key Findings
- **Base Process Performance**: $11.8 million annual profit
- **Optimized Process Performance**: $18.8 million annual profit
- **20-Year NPV (8% IR)**: 
  - Base Case: $115.9 million
  - Optimized Case: $183.4 million
